    <h2> How is Republic Day Celebrated</h2>
    <p1><h4>India Republic Day is celebrated on 26 January every year. It was 1950 when Dr. Rajendra Prasad our first president hoisted the tricolor on Rajpath, Delhi. Our first chief guest was the President of Indonesia, Mr. Sukarno. Similarly, in 2021 Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was invited as a guest of honor but the planning has been recently canceled due to the corona crisis. Every year we invite various famous personalities to be a part of our celebration.
    We have been celebrating this occasion since the year 1950 and it has been declared a national holiday. We celebrate this day because we got our constitution on this day. It took 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days to make our constitution and was completed by 26 November 1949. We also celebrate 26 November as our Constitution day. On 26 January 1950, it was announced to enforce our Constitution for the first time.
    We celebrate this occasion with great enthusiasm and Delhi is the center of the Republic Day celebration. India will celebrate its 73rd Republic Day in the year 2022. The cultural programs will be fewer in number and protocols for COVID-19 will be followed strictly.
    The programme on Rajpath includes a small Parade by various armed forces that will be fewer in number. Children under the age of 15 are strictly prohibited to attend the ceremony. People every year visit Delhi to see this programme but this year only a few spectators are allowed to watch the event to avoid overcrowding amid the pandemic. We can also watch the live telecast of the programme on the national channel Doordarshan.
    Generally, schools also celebrate this occasion and organize various programmes. People all over India celebrate this event by hoisting the flag and distributing sweets. Sometimes they also wear tricolors and play patriotic songs and enjoy their day. This year the republic day celebration will be done in the pandemic situation and therefore the way of celebrating the event is changed. It is necessary to remain safe rather than taking risks.People celebrate this day with a lot of zeal and happiness. The President of India hoists the national flag on Rajpath in New Delhi. It is followed by a 21 gun salute and the national anthem. People from all over the country visit the Rajpath to view the grand celebration of Republic Day. The first President who hoisted the flag ceremony was Dr Rajendra Prasad.
    In school, colleges, government offices and private organisations, the celebration is enjoyed with full enthusiasm. March past and parade takes place in schools along with the other functions. Many schools distribute sweets to students. Indians across the country celebrate the spirit of freedom and forget the differences between them, such as caste, religion, language and culture.
    We hope students must have found this essay on Republic Day helpful for their studies.

<h2>History of Republic Day</h2>
<p2><h4>Republic Day is of great historical importance. We got freedom from the British on 15 August 1947, but we were not having any form of government or constitution or political parties. On 26th January 1950, India implemented the Constitution. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as the President of Indian National Congress and Poorna Swaraj was declared on 26th January 1930. However, we got independence on 15 August 1947.
    After independence, a special constituent assembly was appointed for making the Constitution of India. Dr B.R Ambedkar led the constitution drafting committee. While creating India’s constitution, other countries’ constitutions have also been referred to, so as to create the best constitution. After 166 days, the Constitution of India was finally made. It was created in such a manner that all citizens of India could enjoy equal rights pertaining to their religions, culture, caste, sex and creed. On 26th January 1950, the Constitution of India was adopted and implemented, and the day is referred to as Republic Day. Moreover, it marks the end of the British rule and birth of India as a Republic State.

<h2>Significance of This Day</h2>
<p><h4>It is to be noted that January 26 had a great significance in India’s struggle for Swaraj. The Congress Session at Lahore on December 29, 1929, had passed a resolution declaring Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence) as India’s goal. It was also decided that the 26th of January should be observed all over India as the Purna Swaraj Day. The complete Independence Day was for the first time celebrated on January 26th, 1930. It continued to be so observed until 1947. On achieving Independence, August 15 became our Independence Day. 
    January 26th, however, marked a great event in India’s struggle for freedom. It was, therefore, in the favour of all that January 26 should be selected as the Date of Commencement of the new Constitution. 
    Therefore, this day is celebrated as a day of national significance with great joy and pride. </h4></p>
    <h2>Conclution</h2>
    <p><h4>The patriotic ardour of the people on this day brings the whole country together with all her cultural diversities. Every part of the country participates in the occasion, which makes Republic Day the most popular of all the national holidays of India. </h4></p>
